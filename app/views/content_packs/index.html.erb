    <h4>What are Content Packs?</h4>
    <p>Content packs import a snapshot of Pirep's airport database directly into ForeFlight to take on the go. Multiple content packs are provided, one for all of Pirep's airports or targeted content packs with only specific airports tags.</p>

    <div class="alert alert-warning mb-3">
      <i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation me-1"></i>ForeFlight does not support automatic updating of content packs. Content packs must be manually updated periodically by re-downloading them from this page to ensure the data they contain remains up to date.

    <h4>Content Pack Installation</h4>

    <% if ios?(request) %>
      <p>Download the content pack .zip file and then open it with ForeFlight on your iPad or iPhone.</p>
    <% else %>
      <p>It is easiest to install a content pack by opening this page directly on your iPad or iPhone. However, they can also be installed by downloading a .zip file below, transferring it to your device, and then opening it with ForeFlight from a file manager app.</p>

    <h4>Content Pack Usage</h4>

    <p>Once added to ForeFlight, airports may be viewed via a layer on ForeFlight's main map view and managed through the "custom content" settings.</p>
