  Sentry is served here outside of the import map because despite my best efforts I cannot get it to work with import maps.
  See https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/6141 for a feature request to support import maps.
  This isn't a big deal though since we need to dynamically put the user ID in the Sentry context which means we need to
  have this in the view layer anyway.

  `sentry.min.js` is the CDN file as found here: https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/install/cdn/

<% if Rails.application.credentials.sentry_dsn_frontend %>
  <%= javascript_include_tag 'sentry.min.js' %>

  <%= javascript_tag nonce: true do %>
    Sentry.init({
      dsn: '<%= Rails.application.credentials.sentry_dsn_frontend %>',
    });

    <% if current_user %>
      Sentry.configureScope(scope => {
        scope.setUser({id: '<%= current_user.id %>'});
      });
    <% end %>
  <% end %>
<% end %>
