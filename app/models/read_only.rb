  # Since this class is intended to be used in the Rails configuration this means that it will try to be loaded when the application
  # is initialized. However, in some cases (Rake tasks, tests, etc.) the database may not be connected or the table for this class
  # has not been created yet. Thus, we need to only attempt to hit the database once it's ready. Since this class a singleton that
  # means having a loader class which lazy loads anything from the database. This allows us to create the loader object when the
  # application initializes but nothing will hit the database until a method is explicitly called.
